    Engineers typically do not want to put one on their resume and it's better to have it as an optional cover letter.

Passionate about programming and creating things from a very young age, I'm a self-starter, a polyglot, and have used countless languages, tech, and stacks.
I focus on **full-stack** web development but have also dabbled in game development.
I'm fascinated with **UI/UX** and have always been regarded as the company **React**, **HTML**, and **CSS** expert.
I have experience as a leader and mentor and a track record of providing measurable impact to my teams.
I also actively contribute to open source!
